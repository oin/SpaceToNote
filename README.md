#  SpaceToNote

A [SIMBL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMBL) plug-in that provides small enhancements to the following applications:

 - [Curio 10](https://www.zengobi.com/curio/), a freeform notebook environment
 - [Tinderbox 7](http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/), a _tool for notes_ to visualize, analyze, and share ideas.

In these applications, the plug-in adds the ability to summon a rich text or note window by just pressing the `SPACE` bar, also known as the largest key on your keyboard.

It merely provides another way to use an existing feature in both programs, but it makes it so much more effortless that you'll find yourself making tons of additional notes.
Who knows, you might end up with a better perspective on whatever you're doing with these applications.
This could have real-life consequences!

## Get it

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/oin/SpaceToNote/releases).

## Installation

Make sure you have SIMBL (or [mySIMBL](https://github.com/w0lfschild/mySIMBL), or whatever flavor) installed, put [SpaceToNote.bundle](https://github.com/oin/SpaceToNote/releases) in `/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins`, and restart Curio or Tinderbox.

## How to use it

### In Curio

Press the `SPACE` bar to show the _Notes Inspector_ for the selected asset, or for the current idea space if it is focused.

As a quick press of the `SPACE` bar is also mapped to a few actions (e.g., QuickLook, or collapsing/expanding collections), SpaceToNotes tries to avoid showing the _Notes Inspector_ when it was supposed to do something else.
You can still use âŒƒ + `SPACE` or double-`SPACE` to force the _Notes Inspector_ to appear.

### In Tinderbox

Press the `SPACE` bar to show the _Text window_ for the selected note.
This replicates the functionality in Tinderbox 5 and earlier.
